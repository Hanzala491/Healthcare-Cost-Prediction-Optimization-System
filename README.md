# 🏥 Healthcare Cost Prediction & Optimization System

## 📌 Overview
The Healthcare Cost Prediction & Optimization System is an end-to-end analytics pipeline designed to forecast patient-level healthcare costs, stratify risk, and optimize medical resource allocation using machine learning and data science techniques.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulates real-world patient healthcare data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Detailed visual insights into cost drivers and chronic conditions.
- **ML Cost Prediction Models**: Implements Random Forest & XGBoost for cost forecasting.
- **Risk Stratification**: Classifies patients into four risk tiers.
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocates doctors, nurses, beds, and budget based on patient risk.
- **ROI Analysis**: Evaluates financial return for various health interventions.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built using Plotly and Power BI.
- **API Integration**: Real-time cost prediction and recommendation system.
- **Database Support**: Full MySQL schema for integration and reporting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MySQL + SQLAlchemy
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Docker, Power BI
